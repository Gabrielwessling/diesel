# DIESEL
### A post-apocalyptic traditional roguelike with (the idea of having) modern mouse and WASD support for movement, attacking and using all other actions.

### The lore and vibe are almost non-existant outside some ideas that I had in the past. Humour mixed with low life expectancy, goods being valued 100x even the richest lifes in this world and a whole 200 years of forgotten history and tech.

## Controls
- WASD: vertical/horizontal movement.
- Q/E: upper diagonal movement
- Z/C: upper diagonal movement
- X, Mouse hovering: see what's on a tile
- H: notification history
- Left mouse button: target some abilities (in the future you will be able to attack just using this, melee or ranged).
- ESC: quit game, return to game from inventory and other menus
- Right mouse button: return
- Shift + . (>): descend stairs

## Current Goal
### Duild the backbone and slowly turn this into a fun game with at least a little replayability. Of course, trying to always keep it modern with the traditional rogue structure.

## The ~~mess~~ Software
- The game is written in python using the TCOD library, which I'm pretty sure uses libtcod behind the curtains. I mainly using it for:
  - Line algorithms
  - Some FOV stuff
  - Generation
  - Display
  - if I'm forgetting something please let me know!
- This stuff is based on the roguelike tutorial for python, and now I'm just going forward and adding what makes sense. This project is just for fun, to learn something and to feel good about doing something. It's mostly for friends and family.


### The portuguese stuff is just for testing and mostly there cause I'm brazillian and I never left here. For this reason it's impossible for me to come to brazil.
